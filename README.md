### 👋 I'm Noah, otherwise known as eeue56

### tl;dr

My day-job role is to help the technical part of Schibsted News Media grow, for all definitions of growth. I help enact our strategies by removing road blocks for developers, creating new roads and bridges, and sometimes speed limit signs. I facilitate teams, and keep an eye out for potential problems and solutions.

My volunteer job is founder & chair of the [Tekna Network for Developers](https://www.tekna.no/fag-og-nettverk/IKT/nettverk-for-utviklere/).

Creator of [Derw](https://www.derw-lang.com/).

### Things that drive me

- 🤝 Helping people! This is my biggest driver, and almost everything I do is because I think it could help people.
- 📚 I want to know a little bit of everything, and dive deep into things I find useful or interesting.
- 🚒 I love fixing things when stuff goes wrong. I always wanted to be a firefighter as a kid. Sometimes I still do.
- 💬 I'm always up for a chat, whether it's about work, the world in general, or the life experience.
- 🖊️ Writing, documenting, communicating.

### Things to keep in mind about me

- 🧠 I am biased, but try to be objective and reflect the opinions of the org. If I ever give my personal opinion, I label it clearly!
- 🔥 I love productive disagreements, where there is respect, and passion. Agreeing all the time isn't healthy. You won't offend me if you disagree with me.
- 🤔 I like to think about things over for a long time, then get things done quickly. I value pragmatism, and don't let perfect become the enemy of good.

### Languages I speak

- Welsh is my mother tongue
- **English is my backup mother tongue, and my preferred work language** (though I speak American English, I'm Welsh)
- Swedish is roughly B2 reading and listening, less good speaking or writing. I am shy in Swedish. Can watch movies or TV fine and understand everything. Dialects though... that's a hard one.
- Norwegian is similar to Swedish, though I do end up speaking Svorsk a little. I am shy in Norwegian too.
- I know enough French to interview a Swiss village of only elderly French speakers, but it takes a while for me to get back into it.
- My Spanish is at the "I can get by but don't ask my life story" level, and latin-America focused.

### One random fact

You made it to the end! Congrats! Here's one random fact about me: I lived in an abandoned church for 4 years, while running a startup. It was so cold that we had to take 10 minute breaks to hold our hands in front of a fire, but we got stuff done.
